			I'm a Canadian student studying Electrical Engineering Computer Science and Material Science Engineering at UC Berkeley. I enjoy algorithms and UX/UI design. </br></br> I spend too much time theorizing about games and optimizing before even playing. Current timesinks include writing MIPS for my Machine Structures class, proofs for Discrete Math homework, and Path of Exile theorycrafting.
