			I'm a Canadian student studying Electrical Engineering Computer Science and Material Science Engineering at UC Berkeley. I enjoy math, algorithms, and UX/UI design. Right now I'm a reader, grading our Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs class and a lab assistant for the Discrete Math for Computer Scientists class.</br></br> Other timesinks include spending too much time theorizing about games and turning them into optimization problems rather than actually playing. This is particularly true for Path of Exile.
